# Contributing to Cryptography Application

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Cryptography-Application.git
   cd Cryptography-Application
   ```
3. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 6+, MSVC 2019+)
- CMake 3.16+
- Qt5 development libraries
- OpenSSL development libraries
- Crypto++ development libraries
- Boost libraries

### Build and Test
```bash
# Build the project
./build.sh

# Run all tests
cd vm-testing/phase1-unit-tests && ./run_tests.sh
```

## üìù Code Style

### C++ Guidelines
- Follow **C++17** standards
- Use **RAII** principles for resource management
- Prefer **smart pointers** over raw pointers
- Use **const correctness** throughout
- Follow **camelCase** for variables and functions
- Use **PascalCase** for classes and structs

### Example:
```cpp
class CryptoEngine {
private:
    std::unique_ptr<AESCrypto> aesEngine;
    const std::string algorithmName;

public:
    explicit CryptoEngine(const std::string& name) 
        : algorithmName(name) {}
    
    OperationResult encryptFile(const std::string& inputPath, 
                               const std::string& outputPath) const;
};
```

### Documentation
- Use **Doxygen** style comments for public APIs
- Include parameter and return value descriptions
- Add usage examples for complex functions

## üß™ Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

### Unit Tests
- Add tests to `vm-testing/phase1-unit-tests/`
- Test new cryptographic functions thoroughly
- Verify error handling and edge cases

### Integration Tests
- Add end-to-end workflow tests to `vm-testing/phase2-integration-tests/`
- Test GUI interactions if applicable

### Security Tests
- Security-related changes require additional validation
- Consider cryptographic best practices

## üîí Security Considerations

### Cryptographic Code
- **Never implement custom cryptographic algorithms**
- Use established libraries (OpenSSL, Crypto++)
- Follow cryptographic best practices
- Clear sensitive data from memory when possible

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize file paths and names
- Check buffer boundaries
- Handle errors gracefully

### Code Review
Security-sensitive changes require:
- Detailed code review
- Security testing
- Documentation of security implications

## üìã Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Ensure all tests pass**:
   ```bash
   cd vm-testing/phase1-unit-tests && ./run_tests.sh
   ```
2. **Update documentation** if needed
3. **Add appropriate tests** for new features
4. **Follow code style guidelines**

### Pull Request Guidelines
- **Clear title** describing the change
- **Detailed description** explaining:
  - What changes were made
  - Why the changes were necessary
  - How to test the changes
- **Reference related issues** if applicable
- **Include screenshots** for GUI changes

### Review Process
1. Automated tests must pass
2. Code review by maintainers
3. Security review for cryptographic changes
4. Documentation review
5. Final approval and merge
