This is a sample text file for testing the Cryptography Application.

The application provides the following features:

1. AES-256 Encryption
   - Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys
   - CBC mode with random initialization vectors
   - Suitable for encrypting files of any size

2. RSA-2048 Encryption  
   - Public key cryptography with 2048-bit keys
   - OAEP padding for security
   - Best suited for key exchange and small data

3. Blowfish Encryption
   - Fast block cipher with variable key length
   - Good for applications requiring speed
   - Key size up to 448 bits

4. Hash Functions
   - SHA-256: Secure Hash Algorithm with 256-bit output
   - MD5: Message Digest Algorithm (legacy support)
   - File integrity verification

5. Digital Signatures
   - RSA digital signatures with SHA-256/MD5
   - Non-repudiation and authenticity verification
   - Detached signature support

6. Secure Storage
   - Password-protected encrypted file storage
   - Automatic encryption with unique file keys
   - Metadata protection and integrity checking

This file can be used to test encryption, hashing, and digital signature operations.
