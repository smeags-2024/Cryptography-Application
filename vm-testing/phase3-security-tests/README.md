## üîß Security Testing Framework

#include <openssl/evp.h>
#include <cryptopp/cryptlib.h>
#include "security/security_validator.h"

class SecurityTest : public ::testing::Test {
protected:
    void SetUp() override {
        // Initialize security testing environment
        securityValidator = new SecurityValidator();
        
        // Setup secure test environment
        setupSecureTestEnv();
    }
    
    void TearDown() override {

        secureCleanup();
        delete securityValidator;
    }
    
private:
    SecurityValidator* securityValidator;
};
```

### Example Security Test
```cpp
TEST_F(SecurityTest, AESTimingAttackResistance) {
    const size_t iterations = 10000;
    const size_t keySize = 32; // AES-256
    
    std::vector<uint64_t> encryptionTimes;
    encryptionTimes.reserve(iterations);
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
        // Generate random key and data
        std::vector<uint8_t> key = generateRandomKey(keySize);
        std::vector<uint8_t> plaintext = generateRandomData(16);
        
        // Measure encryption time
        auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        auto ciphertext = aesEncrypt(plaintext, key);
        auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        
        auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::nanoseconds>(end - start);
        encryptionTimes.push_back(duration.count());
    }
    
    // Analyze timing distribution
    double variance = calculateVariance(encryptionTimes);
    double mean = calculateMean(encryptionTimes);
    double coefficientOfVariation = sqrt(variance) / mean;
    
    // Timing should be consistent (low coefficient of variation)
    ASSERT_LT(coefficientOfVariation, 0.05) << "Timing attack vulnerability detected";
